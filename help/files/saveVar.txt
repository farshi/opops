Description:
  Storing A value in a Variable in opops call chain!

Usage:
  $opops saveVar "RT_VALUE" "$(KEY)"
  
  It is recommended to add RT prefix to the value so the stored value can be distinguished from 
  other variables which are populated from the env files or profiles.

Example:

  $opops saveVar "RT_KMS_KEY_ID" "$(KMS_KEY_ID)"

  In the above example we retrieved KMS_KEY_ID and store it in RT_KMS_KEY_ID
  The value can be retrieved using simple ${RT_KMS_KEY_ID} in the opops call chain!
